# Kaggle-DisasterTweets
This repository constains 2 notebooks - 

The first one is NLP reference notebook which I created as I learnt the concepts of NLP. It contains the template for all types of methods used for text representation, text cleaning and building NLP models. I will keep updating this one as I progress along the learning curve, adding templates to solve advanced problems.

The second one - Kaggle Disaster Tweets is the solution to the Kaggle Disaster Tweet Dataset, which is generally the Getting Started dataset for NLP on Kaggle.
